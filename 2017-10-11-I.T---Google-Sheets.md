For the past few weeks in computing, we have been working on Google sheets. We have been making code to encode and decode script. I found this subject very fun, and I enjoy making the code and learning about how to make it better. First, we looked at a basic code, which was actually not so basic on the inside. I had a little bit of an advantage, as I had done House codebreaking, and my house Newman, came first. We did a code that if you type one letter, then a different letter will appear where you tell it to. Me and my friend used the key phrase: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'. I Used this phrase as it covers every letter of the alphabet at least once. So, we laid it out with the letter from A-Z down the first column, and the phrase ‘The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog’ in the column next to that. I can’t use any of the letters twice, so when I came across one that I had already used, I simply just miss it out. After this, My class’s I.T teacher, Mr Tansley, told us about the code he used. We had the message we wanted to use in one random row next to the code. My chosen message was ‘Scotland is the best.’ My Friend copied me and did the same thing. Then I typed the code into the row underneath I did my chosen message. I pretty much already knew the code from 

House Codebreaking in Year 8. After I typed in 'Scotland is the best', my code, which thankfully worked, displayed the message: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>s</td>
    <td>e</td>
    <td>x</td>
    <td>v</td>
    <td>w</td>
    <td>t</td>
    <td>f</td>
    <td>q</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>b</td>
    <td>s</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>v</td>
    <td>k</td>
    <td>u</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>h</td>
    <td>u</td>
    <td>s</td>
    <td>v</td>
  </tr>
</table>


I have learnt a lot from the past few lessons. Unfortunately, we missed one for enrichment day, but I still learnt a lot more about coding. We learnt how to make sure it doesn't display an error, and we also learnt how to make it display spaces. There are some things, however, that I did not need Mr Tansley for. I worked out how to make my code decode an encrypted code e.g It turned 'sexvwtfq bs vku husv’ into the message of which I had originally put into my encoding machine, ‘Scotland is the best’. I worked long and hard at trying to do this method in just the two columns, and just changing the code, but after a lot of minutes of trying, I gave up. I agreed to all of the people sitting around me that It could not be done. You needed three columns. I checked with Mr Tansley, my teacher, if I was right in the first place, and it could be done with just two columns. But my first idea WAS wrong, much to my disappointment. Although, after finding out that it couldn’t be done with just the two columns, I had made in the first place, I added a third column of all of the letters of the alphabet (A-Z) so I could change it back. I did the code with ease, without any help whatsoever. I did not need to ask for any help, from my friends, or the rest of my class, or even my teacher. It was not as hard as I am making out for it to be, but I am still quite proud of myself for working it out.

I have thoroughly enjoyed I.T from the start of this half term. I'm not 100% sure why. I’ve very much enjoyed having Mr Tansley, and I have also really like doing Google sheets. This has probably been my favourite subject in I.T. Not just this year, not just this school, but probably my best I.T subject in both of my schools. This subject has boosted my confidence in I.T, and I think it has pushed me closer into choosing I.T as one of my GCSE’s.

Therefore, overall, I have very enjoyed I.T so far this half term, as I have really really enjoyed doing google sheets. It has definitely been my favourite coding website so far. Better than Codecademy. Even, probably better than FUZE. I think that I have done quite well overall in google sheets. I haven't really struggled at all. I didn’t need Mr Tansley as much as some other people. I don’t think that I am exceeding, above every other person in my class and my year, but I think that I am doing fairly well and I am definitely in the top 50% in my class. I am almost definitely going to take on I.T in my GCSE’s. I have loved doing Google Sheets.

Thank you for reading
