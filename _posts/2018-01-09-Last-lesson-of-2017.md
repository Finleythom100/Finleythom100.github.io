This was our very last I.T lesson of 2017, as in two days, we will break up for the Christmas and the New Year holidays. We are still working on repl.it at the moment, and I am not entirely sure if we will keep working on our AI on repl.it next year, or if we will change to a different subject. When we had Mr Tansley, it did not last as long as me and all of my other classmates had expected, so I don't think we have very long left of I.T. On repl.it, have have made significant progress. Currently, I have 15 questions on my code. Some of the are multiple choice questions, however some are not. The questions are simple things and include: What is your favourite colour? The answer will say: I love that colour too! Another question could ask: Who is your favourite actor; Adam Sandler, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rowan Atkinson or You don't watch TV. There would be a different response to each answer. After I had done one multiple choice question and one non multiple choice question, It got pretty easy after that, as all I had to do was copy and paste it, then change the question, and, for the multiple choice questions, the choices.Therefore, I think that since we have started repl.it, I have gotten a lot better, and I can now do 15 questions flawlessly.
