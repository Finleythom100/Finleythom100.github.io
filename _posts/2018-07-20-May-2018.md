May 2018

We have finally started our GCSE course and for this half term only we are doing IT as our enrichment subject. I am very happy that we can do IT one last time as I was very close to choosing it as one of mkky 4 GCSE subjects, however I decided to choose electronics instead. But if I want, I can change to IT if I enjoy it this half term. I was also very happy because Mr Keen was my teacher.

As we got in, Mr Keen informed us that we could choose what coding website to go on. Most people, including me chose scratch. I enjoyed working on scratch as i hadn't been on it since year 7 when we made Pacman. I decided to make a princess and the frog story.
